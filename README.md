# freebsd-scripts
A collection of shell scripts to perform common actions on FreeBSD.

Currently, the bulk of this project are the scripts in the lib directory that provide functions for other scripts to use. I've made changes to make those libraries more flexible before sharing them, and I'll release additional scripts over time as I update them to incorporate those changes.

The portsfetch script can be used to switch to the current quarterly branch for FreeBSD ports and to update your local ports tree after switching. See [Using Quarterly Ports on FreeBSD](https://chriswells.io/blog/using-quarterly-ports-on-freebsd) for background information and usage instructions.
