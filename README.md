# freebsd-scripts
A collection of shell scripts to perform common actions on FreeBSD.

Currently, the most useful parts of this project are the scripts in the lib directory that provide functions for other scripts to use. I've made changes to make those libraries more flexible before sharing them, and I'll release additional scripts over time as I update them to incorporate those changes.

Feedback and contributions are welcome!
